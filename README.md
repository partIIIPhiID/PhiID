# PhiID
Code, csvs, plots made during the course of my Part III project with the concog lab. This github is an anonymised account with some of the files from my personal gitlab, made to be part of my lab diary. Key scripts are LDA_truthtable_proper.py, main_randelectrode, main_crosspart.m, automate_csv_heatmap.m, csv_heatmap_gen and the corresponding SLURM submission scripts for MATLAB scripts.

All files in this account are my own work and nothing was modified past the submission deadline (16:00 16/05/22)
